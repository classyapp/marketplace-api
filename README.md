Dependencies
====

You'll need:

* MongoDB - [instructions here](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)
* Redis - redis is not available for Windows but [there's a port that's good enough for development](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis) - you'll need to build the executables using the instructions in the readme there and then just run `redis-server.exe`
